1.  Firewalls block bad connections, SSL allows for HTTPS, monitoring adds logging tools
2.  Each firewall will prevent bad actors from connecting to the load balancer or servers
3.  Traffic is served over HTTPS for security because the connection is encrypted
4.  Monitoring is used to log stuff so that if things explode we can do forensic investigations
5.  Every single request and response is logged
6.  QPS is Queries Per Second. There could be logging added to the web server for routes / APIs
7.  Connection between load balancer and sever is unsecured
8.  It becomes a point of failure should there be too many simultaneous connections
9.  If something goes wrong, it might be hard to figure out which server exploded since everything is the same
