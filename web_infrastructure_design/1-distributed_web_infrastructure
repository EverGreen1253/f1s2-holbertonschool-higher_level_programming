1.  I added the load balancer so that there would be a distributed load between the servers
2.  I would use the Least Connection First Scheduling for the Load Balancer
3.  I would use active-active. But it makes things complicated because if the servers stores user session data, then they would need to somehow share details between each other if a user logs into one.

4.  Database replication can be done asynchrnously or synchronously

5.  Primary and Replica difference:
    The source database server is referred to as the primary server, and the server receiving the copied data is known as the replica server. In PostgreSQL, all writes go to a primary node. Changes are made there and then broadcasted to the secondary nodes.

Where is the SPOF? The load balancer
Security Issues: It may be possible to force traffic to go to a specific machine via the load balancer
No Monitoring: Monitoring should be installed on either the application server side or web server side
